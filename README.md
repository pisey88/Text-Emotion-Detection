# 🧠 Emotion Detection from Text using NLP & ML

This project explores the integration of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to detect and classify emotions from text. We use a labeled dataset from Kaggle to train a model that categorizes text into emotional classes such as **joy**, **sadness**, **anger**, and **surprise**.

A **Streamlit**-based web application enables real-time emotion classification for users. Model evaluation is based on accuracy, precision, and confusion matrices.

## 🎯 Objectives

-  Conduct literature review on emotion detection using ML and NLP
-  Preprocess a labeled dataset (cleaning, stopword removal, vectorization)
-  Train a classification model using Logistic Regression + CountVectorizer
-  Build a web app for real-time text emotion detection using **Streamlit**
-  Visualize model performance using **seaborn** and **matplotlib**
-  Document findings and propose future improvements
